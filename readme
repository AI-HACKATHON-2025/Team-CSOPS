## 🚀 Overview  

This project is a web-based AI-powered learning mentor designed to enhance student learning by:  
✅ Generating 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on a given topic.  
✅ Analyzing student performance to identify weak areas.  
✅ Recommending YouTube video lectures to improve understanding.  
✅ Built using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend).
